## SolidWaste2018 -- Testing the probability of garbage
### Semester project EPFL Solid Waste Engineering

#### If you don't have an environment set up, or if you are unfamiliar with python you can see all the notebooks and use them interactiveley by clicking the badge below. The introduction note books will be coming up shortly!

Masters students in Environmental Engineering from the [École Polytechnique Féderale de Lausanne](https://enac.epfl.ch/environmental-engineering) test the hypothesis that litter densities on Lac Léman are predicatable. The current method is based on the Probability Density Function derived from the logarithm of the pieces/meter of trash (pcs/m) from over 100 samples.

Workbooks are incremental and intended to display results and methods.

Contributions are limited to students in the group, EPFL professors and hammerdirt staff.

#### However if you want to clone this repo or provide alternative analysis methods. Go ahead and submit a pull request on a seperate notebook. We can always get better at what we do!

### Getting the data:
All the data for survey results is available through the hammeridrt API:
